# Rashino's Prompts

## Overview

Here's a list of prompts that I have created over time. Some take inspiration from existing prompts, but I have tried to put my own spin on them.

## Prompts

- [General Use Prompts](./prompts/current/general.md) - Can be used for a variety of tasks.
- [Vanilla Coding](./prompts/in-progress/vanilla_coding_v1.4.md) - An updated, more powerful version of the previous [AI Coding](./prompts/archived/coding/ai_coding_v1.2.md) prompt.
- [Prompt Analysis](./prompts/current/prompt_analysis.md) - Analyze other prompts for improvement in the prompt itself, deconstruction of the prompt for recreation, and more.

> [!NOTE]
> There are many other prompts that I still need to add, but for now I will just be putting a few here.
